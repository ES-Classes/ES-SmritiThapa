Arjun wants to build a very simple tip calculator for whenever he goes eating in a restaurant. In his country, it's usual to tip 10% if the bill value is between 50 and 300. If the value is different, the tip is 15%.
Your tasks:

    Calculate the tip, depending on the bill value.
    Print a string to the console containing the bill value, the tip, and the final value (bill + tip). Example:

        “The bill was Rs. 200, the tip was Rs. 20, and the total is Rs. 220”

Test data:

    Test for bill values 275, 40 and 430
