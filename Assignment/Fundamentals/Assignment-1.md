Prabin and Ram comparing their BMI (Body Mass Index), which is calculated using the formula:

BMI = mass / height ** 2 = mass / (height * height)

(mass in kg and height in meter).
Your tasks:

    Store Prabin's and Ram's mass and height in variables
    Calculate both their BMIs using the formula
    Create a Boolean variable 'prabinHigherBMI' containing information about whether Prabin has a higher BMI than Ram.
    You need to calculate BIM
