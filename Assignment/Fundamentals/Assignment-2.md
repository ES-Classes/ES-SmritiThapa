There are two basketball teams, NepalA and NepalB. They played against each other 3 times. The team with the highest average score wins a trophy.
Your tasks:

    Calculate the average score for each team, using the test data below.
    Compare the team's average scores to determine the winner of the tournament, and print it to the console. (Can be draw as well)
    Include a requirement for a minimum avergae score of 50 points. With this rule, a team only wins if it has a higher score than the other team, and at the same time a score of at least 50 points.
    Minimum score rule also applies to a draw! So a draw only happens when both teams have the same score and both have a score greater or equal 50 points. Otherwise, no team wins the trophy

    Test Data 1: NepalA score 46, 58 and 39. NepalB score 48, 41 and 60
